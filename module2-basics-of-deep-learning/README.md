# 🧠 Module 2: Backpropagation & Activation Functions  

This module covers the mathematical and practical foundations of how neural networks **learn** through backpropagation, and how the choice of **activation functions** impacts training efficiency, convergence, and accuracy.

## 📘 What I Learned  

- **Gradient Descent**  
  - Iterative optimization algorithm for minimizing cost functions.  
  - Update rule:  
    ```
    w(t+1) = w(t) - α * ∂J/∂w
    ```
  - Role of the learning rate (α): too large → overshoot, too small → slow convergence.  

- **Backpropagation**  
  - Training process for neural networks using the **chain rule** to compute weight/bias gradients.  
  - Steps:  
    1. Forward propagation → compute predictions.  
    2. Compute error (loss).  
    3. Backpropagate error → compute gradients w.r.t. weights and biases.  
    4. Update parameters using gradient descent.  
  - Example: XOR problem learned successfully with a 2-layer NN.  

- **Activation Functions**  
  - Introduce **non-linearity** → without them, networks collapse into linear models.  
  - **Sigmoid (σ(z))**: outputs in (0,1), derivative = `σ(z)(1-σ(z))`.  
    - Good for binary classification outputs.  
    - Problem: vanishing gradient in deep nets.  
  - **Tanh**: outputs in (-1,1), zero-centered.  
    - Still suffers vanishing gradient.  
  - **ReLU**: `max(0,z)`  
    - Solves vanishing gradient for positive z.  
    - Default for hidden layers.  
  - **Softmax**: converts logits into probabilities for classification.  

- **Vanishing Gradient Problem**  
  - In deep nets, repeated multiplications of values <1 (from sigmoid/tanh derivatives) → gradients shrink toward 0.  
  - Early layers learn very slowly.  
  - ReLU was a breakthrough that solved this problem.

## 📝 Quiz Review  

- Gradient descent = iterative optimization algorithm.  
- Backpropagation starts with **error calculation**.  
- Sigmoid, tanh, softmax suffer vanishing gradients.  
- ReLU doesn’t activate all neurons simultaneously.  
- Softmax is ideal in classifier output layers.

## 🔗 Connection to Next Modules  

- Builds directly on Module 1 (forward propagation).  
- Sets the foundation for **deep architectures** (CNNs, RNNs).  
- Prepares for using **Keras** in real projects where activation choices and gradient behavior are critical.

## 🧠 Ahmad’s Reflection  

- ✅ I now understand backpropagation deeply — it’s just chain rule + gradient descent.  
- ❓ Curious about advanced optimizers (SGD, Adam, RMSProp) and ReLU variants (Leaky ReLU, GELU).  
- 🚀 I can now implement a simple NN with backprop from scratch in NumPy.  
- 💡 Interesting: ReLU’s simplicity (max(0,z)) was the breakthrough that enabled modern deep learning.
